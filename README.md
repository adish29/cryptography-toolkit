Python code of important cryptography algorithms<br/>
--> Extended Euclidian Algorithm - used to find the inverse of a mod b <br/>
--> Modtabs - For a given input n define order for elements from 1 to n-1 <br/>
--> Russian Peasant - multiplication of two polynomials in hex notations <br/>
--> Square and Multiply - In mathematics and computer programming, exponentiating by squaring is a general method for fast computation of large positive integer powers of a number, or more generally of an element of a semigroup, like a polynomial or a square matrix.
